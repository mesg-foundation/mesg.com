These connections to technologies are configured to react to events and execute tasks. <br/><br/>Rather than applications being responsible for the cooperation of other technologies and features, <strong>each technology stands on its own</strong> without a direct connection to anything. Instead, each element (or feature) is set up to listen for a command by any other element. When that command is heard, the microservice reacts by executing its respective task.<br/><br/>This setup allows all elements of applications to function in an independent way, without direct connections to any other feature, so <strong>adding, removing or updating features doesn’t affect the other parts of the application</strong>.<br/><br/>The effect that developers are left with is an application that is easy to update, runs autonomously and works automatically.<br/><br/>While MESG itself uses EDA, any application, regardless of the programming style, is compatible with MESG.'

        content: 'Today, many large internet corporations store and own your data and can share it with other large corporations or even governmental agencies. <strong>Their sole control of data creates a single point of failure</strong> if something were to go wrong.<br/><br/>For example, in recent years, there have been highly-publicized cases of data breaches where login information and identities have been leaked (e.g. Yahoo!, Ashley Madison), in addition to corporations being reprimanded for their misuse of customer data (e.g. Facebook).<br/><br/>Decentralized networks, on the other hand, have no central, regulated hub in which all data runs through. This means that <strong>no single entity or corporation can hold, control and profit off of your data</strong>, and it also means that there is no single point of failure if something were to go wrong.<br/><br/>If one server, or even a group of servers, fails, data will still be available because it’s shared throughout the network. And because all data is distributed rather than centralized, no entity (including MESG itself) can have ownership over your data.<br/><br/>In addition to improved trust and reliability for users and customers, the ability to avoid purchasing, managing, and maintaining servers entirely can <strong>cut costs drastically for many types of businesses</strong>.'

        title: 'How is MESG more efficient than our competitors?',
        content: 'MESG is all about reusing bridges to technologies (MESG Modules). This essentially means: <strong>no more busy work in development</strong>.<br/><br/>When an app or business makes an initial connection to the MESG Infrastructure (at industry-average development times), they can <strong>reuse the connection and will not need to write that connection again</strong> until major changes are made to their software. This translates to a major reduction of development time for all development work after any app or company’s first connection.<br/><br/>If developers want to update their apps with a desired feature that has already been implemented by another developer (for example, a previously-built connection to Spotify’s track playback), you can simply plug in this shared connection from the MESG Marketplace. When using entirely shared or repurposed connections to features, development time can become a small fraction of what it was before.<br/><br/>The MESG Network (coming Q1 2020) adds additional efficiency. Developers and companies can utilize the decentralized network in lieu of running and maintaining their own servers. This provides <strong>easier scalability</strong>, with <strong>more potential processing power</strong> available at any given time.'

        content: 'MESG is all about the sharing and reuse of code. This translates into <strong>significant time savings</strong> for the builders of applications and the writers of business logic.<br/><br/>We’ve determined that on average, developers who are adding new features or updating existing features spend around ⅓ of their time building a bridge (a Module/service) to the desired technology, ⅓ of the time connecting to their application, and the remaining ⅓ getting the two bridges to connect to and cooperate with each other.<br/><br/>After a developer uses MESG once, they will have built a bridge to their app or software, which will be reusable. This means that <strong>this work can be saved each time</strong> henceforth. Additionally, since the software, MESG Core, handles all communication between connected features, the final portion of time spent getting the two bridges to connect and cooperate with each other, is done automatically.<br/><br/>These significant time savings saved <strong>can increase even more</strong> than if the desired technology has already been connected to MESG with a Module. In these cases, when all Modules in an Application are being reused, development time can decrease to a meer fraction of what it was before.'
