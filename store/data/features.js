This means the addition or removal of any feature can be done easily, without heavy reconfiguration. </p><p>Connect to new features, blockchains or even custom software, including monolithic applications, through the MESG Engine.

Systems like SaaS providers typically restrict the functionalities that developers can access, however, all systems feature events. And events are easier to work with. </p><p>Using MESG Modules, you create any applications simply by connecting a third-party event to the execution of a Module. By design, MESG lets you easily have a reactive application that listens for events from any data source, whether it be a web service or a blockchain, allowing for simple and easy-to-maintain modular applications. </p>",

This flexibility extends beyond traditional features, and into decentralized network and blockchain support.  </p><p>When the full decentralized network is released (Q1 of 2020), MESG’s flexibility will extend to decentralization itself. You’ll be able to connect decentralized components together in a decentralized way. Centralizing critical features is no longer required just to add third-party features. </p>",

Servers and local networks can only accommodate so much, plus maintaining your own server can be a costly endeavor.</p><p>To make matters even more difficult, compatibility issues throughout software often mean that choosing a technology or infrastructure limits you to a predefined future trajectory. Restricting possible integrations limits vertical and horizontal scalability.</p><p>Truly serverless applications are the end goal of MESG. Upon the release of MESG’s decentralized network (Q1 2020),  your application can be distributed in a trustless way giving your application unique properties like limitless scalability.</p>",
